Colemak keyboard layout tweaked for easy access to symbols used frequently in programming

Modified from PKL Colemak keyboard layout found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkl/files/Standalone%20Layouts/)

Primary changes:
- Home row becomes frequently-used symbols []{}=!()<> when spacebar (modifier) is held
  - NOTE: Using the spacebar as a modifier takes a bit of getting used to, since spaces are now typed on keyup not keydown.  You'llt ype sentences like }his for a day or two.  The capslock key is a good alternative, but exercises the left pinky considerably more than I'd like. 
- Spacebar modifier provides access to alternate d-pad and home/end keys under luy789 for navigating the cursor to different locations in code without hand relocation
- Symbols on top row use inverted shift-state (2 key is @ when pressed without shift, 2 when pressed with shift) for easier access to less-frequently-used symbols (numbers are primarily entered via the numpad)
- Numpad symbols given shift-state alternate forms for easy typing of common symbols found within number sequences (),:
- -/_ and =/+ moved within easier reach

Potential upcoming changes:
- Make 1 and 0 primary on their keys, since those values are commonly typed when coding
- Consider moving closing characters ]})> to bottom row since IDEs often auto-complete those characters 
- Consider moving other symbols @#$%^&* and perhaps -_+ (and maybe even 1 and 0) to non-pinky keys adjacent to the home row
- Find some way to put the ; symbol on the home row
- Experiment with / in a different location so that HTML closing tags are less awkward -- low priority, since IDEs usually suggest closing tags upon pressing <
- Find some useful function for modified capslock.  Enter, maybe?  Delete?  Just standard backspace?

Non-layout TODOs:
- Update keyboard layout images to match layout
